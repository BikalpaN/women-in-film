How are women portrayed in film? It's a complicated question, and that question might make you think of a male protagonist's romantic interest, or someone in trouble who needs to be rescued, or maybe Wonder Woman.

One way to quantitatively measure how women are portrayed in film is to look at set directions in film scripts. Set directions, if you're not familiar with them, are the part of a script that are not dialogue. They describe actions and reactions, and communicate to the actors, producers, and director what story the script is working to tell. 


```{r pronoun_bigrams}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets)
library(tidytext)
library(stringr)

public_scripts <- gs_title("Public Script Sources")
script_sample <- public_scripts %>%
    gs_read("public_scripts")

all_tsvs <- paste0("setDirections/", list.files(path = "setDirections/", pattern = ".tsv$"))
select_tsvs <- sort(paste0("setDirections/setDirections-", script_sample$script_id, ".tsv"))

sample_tsvs <- intersect(all_tsvs, select_tsvs)

all_lines <- sample_tsvs %>%
    map_df(~data_frame(lines = read_lines(.x)) %>%
               filter(str_detect(lines, "^[0-9]")) %>%
               separate(lines, c("line", "text"), sep = "\t") %>%
               mutate(scriptID = as.integer(str_extract(.x, "[\\d]+"))))

pronoun_bigrams <- all_lines %>%
    unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", 
                  n = 2, collapse = FALSE) %>%
    separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
    filter(word1 %in% c("he", "she")) %>%
    select(scriptID, line, word1, word2) %>%
    filter(!str_detect(word2, "â€™|'"))

*Really rough mock-up of general idea for main viz:*

```{r pronoun_ratio, dependson="pronoun_bigrams", fig.width=5, fig.height=10}

    count(word1, word2) %>%
    spread(word1, n, fill = 0) %>%
    mutate(total = he + she,
           he = (he + 1) / sum(he + 1),
           she = (she + 1) / sum(she + 1),
           logratio = log2(she / he)) %>%
    arrange(desc(logratio)) %>%
    filter(nchar(word2) > 1,
           !(word2 %in% c("door", "ad", "he", "1s", "lp",
                          "car", "himself", "pans", "dead")))

library(ggbeeswarm)
pronoun_ratio %>%
    top_n(800, total) %>%
    mutate(blank = "blank",
           word = reorder(word2, logratio)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(blank, logratio, label = word2)) +
    geom_beeswarm(color = "midnightblue", alpha = 0.4) +
    geom_text(family = "RobotoCondensed-Regular", size = 2.5, 
              vjust = 1.2, hjust = 1.2,
              check_overlap = TRUE) +
    theme_void()

pronoun_ratio %>%
    top_n(800, total) %>%
    mutate(freq = 2 ^ logratio) %>%
    write_csv("~/Desktop/pronoun_word_ratios.csv")

*Label all the outlier points, choose interesting other points to label. For all labeled points, have example text for interactive hover. For non-labeled points, show word on hover.*

    distinct(scriptID, text) %>%
    select(text) %>%
    tail() %>%
    kable()
```



```{r pronoun_imdb, dependson="pronoun_bigrams"}

    rename(imdb = imdb_id)
